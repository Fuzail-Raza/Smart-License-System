## Overview
Smart License System is a groundbreaking project aimed at revolutionizing the traditional driving license process. By seamlessly integrating modern technologies, the system enhances efficiency and user-friendliness, providing a streamlined experience for our local community.

## Key Features

### User Registration
- Users can register and obtain a unique learner ID for the license process.

### Testing Module
- Comprehensive computer-based and practical driving tests for evaluation.

### License Issuance
- Issuance of learner's and permanent licenses with digital notifications and optional home delivery.

### Administrative Interface
- Dual Dashboards: Admin login for system operators to manage users, questions, and license approvals.

## Project Workflow
1. **User Registration:** Users can register and receive a unique ticket for a streamlined process.
2. **Issue Learner to Driver:** Learner's license issued with a validity of 6 months after fulfilling all requirements.
3. **Practice Driving:** Drivers are eligible to take the Symbol Test after 41 days.
4. **Testing Phases:** Comprehensive computer-based and practical driving tests for thorough evaluation.
5. **Driving Test:** If both tests pass, the permanent license is issued with a validity of 5 years.
6. **License Issuance:** Successful candidates receives a permanent license.


## Digital Notifications
Users are kept informed about their application status and test results through digital notifications.

## System Operator Workflow
1. **Issue Learner to Driver:** Learner's license issued with a validity of 6 months after fulfilling all requirements.
2. **Practice Driving:** Drivers are eligible to take the Symbol Test after 41 days.
3. **Symbol Test:** If passed, drivers proceed to the Driving Test; otherwise, they wait for another 41 days.
4. **Driving Test:** If both tests pass, the permanent license is issued with a validity of 5 years.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **User Interface:** JavaFX
- **SMS API:** [infobip.com](https://infobip.com)
- **Package Manager:** Maven
